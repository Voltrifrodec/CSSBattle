  Notes for me:
    - border type first, then border width
    - replace white spaces with '+', so that style would accept the string as a valid style setting (?)
    - no need to write "" if the points above are applied (-2 chars)
    - also, no need to write the end of bracket, that's why clip-path property went last (-1 char)
